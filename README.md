# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

GlobalDateTime is opensource software. I encourage you to modify it as much as possible; but I would like you to send this modifications back and, hence, became an GlobalDateTime contributor. In this way, all the people will benefit from them as you are doing downloading and using GlobalDateTime now.

If you want to contribute to OpenSimMPLS project, follow these instructions:

 - Log in to your GitHub account.
 - Look for GlobalDateTime project.
 - Create a fork of GlobalDateTime (Development branch) in your own GitHub repository.
 - Clone your GlobalDateTime repository to your PC or laptop.
 - Create a branch in your local cloned GIT repository. I recommend to name this branch as "globaldatetime-festureyouaredeveloping" or something similar.
 - Do all modifications on this branch, file additions or deletions, modifications, commits...
 - Push your modifications to your remote github GlobalDateTime repository.
 - Go again to yout GitHub account, choose your GlobalDateTime repository and then your "globaldatetime-festureyouaredeveloping" branch (since the previous step, this branch should be there) and click on the green button at the left. This will guide you to make a pull request (send your modifications on your own GlobalDateTime repository to GlobalDateTime main repository from where you did your fork at the beginning). Choose the development branch of GlobalDateTime as base branch to merge.
 - That's all; I will have your contribution and I will try to merge it into the development branch of GlobalDateTime. Please, comment your contribution as much as possible; I have to be able to understand your contribution.

This is a very easy process. However, if it is very difficult to you, simply send me all your modifications (scenario, sources, documentation...) to:

globaldatetime@manolodominguez.com

And I will do my best to understand them and, somewhat, include your contribution into the project.

REMEMBER!!!! all your contributions have to be compatible with Apache Software License 2.0 and you have to own all rights on them.

#### Thanks for contributing.
